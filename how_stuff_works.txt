You find the min and max of each trait you are using as an anchor 
min value of the anchor goes lower 
max value of the anchor goes higher 

then, for each map
- see where that map falls percentage wise for each trait 
    * this will determine how far along the trait this map will place 
    * hence why this is called the "radius" for that trait 
- add up all the percentage to get the total weights for the map
- now calculate the map's placement if you only consider the trait and its total weight 
- avgerage out the trait placements -> map's final coordinates
