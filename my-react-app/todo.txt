#Opportunity Districts 
-maybe change the rbg value mapping to hsa values
-maybe use a Maxwell color triangle

-use dots to rep each cluster instead
-use the circle again 
-have x value = (x-center of circle) * abs([(white percentage factor) - (black percentage factor)])
-have y value = (y center of circle) * abs([(white percentage facotr) - (hispanic percentage factor)])

#2nd tab
-add a cluster overview 
-add a "representative" overview (avg of everything)
